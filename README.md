Overview
This project features a MongoDB-based dashboard designed for Grazioso Salvare, a rescue animal training company. The dashboard includes interactive widgets connected to the database, providing a user-friendly interface for filtering, sorting, and visualizing data. The implementation was developed using a CRUD Python module and MongoDB aggregation pipelines to meet the company’s specific requirements.

How Do You Write Programs That Are Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable?
Maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs are built with clarity and scalability in mind. For this project, I followed principles such as modularity and proper documentation. The CRUD Python module from Project One played a pivotal role in connecting the database to the dashboard widgets. By separating database operations into a dedicated module, I made the code easier to debug, reuse, and extend.

The advantages of this approach were evident during Project Two when I reused the same CRUD functionality to handle data interactions for the dashboard. In the future, this module could be adapted for other applications, such as managing inventory systems or customer data for small businesses. Writing clean and well-structured code ensures that it can be easily understood and modified by others, which is essential for long-term projects.

How Do You Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks and aligning them with client needs. For this project, I started by analyzing the database and dashboard requirements provided by Grazioso Salvare. I focused on understanding the relationships between the data and the specific queries the client needed for decision-making.

Compared to previous assignments, this project required a more client-centered mindset and a deeper understanding of database interactions. My strategy included outlining the required queries, designing the dashboard’s layout for usability, and iteratively testing each feature. In future projects, I would use this same systematic approach while incorporating client feedback to refine the solution.

What Do Computer Scientists Do, and Why Does It Matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing and implementing technology solutions. This project demonstrates how computational tools can streamline operations and improve decision-making for companies like Grazioso Salvare. By creating a dashboard with dynamic filtering and visualizations, my work enables the company to access critical data quickly, enhancing their ability to track and manage rescue animal training programs.

This type of work is vital because it bridges the gap between complex data and actionable insights. It empowers businesses to work more efficiently, make informed decisions, and ultimately achieve their goals more effectively.
